# Pixar Movie Trailers Website Project

Pixar Movie Trailers Website Project is my final project for Udacity's Programming Foundations with Python.

The assignment was to create a website which showcases our favorite movie trailers. Using Python, we created a Movie class. Within this class are instance variables to information about the movie. We were provided with a Python module which rendered our Movie instances into a website built within the Bootstrap framework, which I made small customizations to.

## Quick Start

Please have Python 2 installed on your system. [Instructions to install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Download all files that are part of the Pixar Movie Trailers Website Project. Move to a directory of your choice. All included files must be placed in the same directory.

Within your command line interface, change working directory to the directory where the project files are saved.

Once in the correct working directory, run this command:

```
python entertainment_center.py
```

If successful, a browser window will open with the Pixar Movie Trailers Website Project.

You can now view all trailers.
